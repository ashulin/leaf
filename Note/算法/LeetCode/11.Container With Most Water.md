### Container With Most Water

Given *n* non-negative integers *a1*, *a2*, ..., *an* , where each represents a point at coordinate (*i*, *ai*). *n* vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line *i* is at (*i*, *ai*) and (*i*, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note:** You may not slant the container and *n* is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

 

**Example:**

```yml
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.length - 1;
        int maxArea = 0;
        while(left < right){
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, Math.min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left));
            if (height[left] < height[right]){
                left++;
            }else {
                right--;
            }
        }
        return maxArea;
    }
}
```
